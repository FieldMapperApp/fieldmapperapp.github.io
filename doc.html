        <p>
          FieldMapper is a Cordova-powered android app that facilitates the collection of geo-referenced data in
          fieldwork settings. Essentially, FieldMapper's interface lets you create features (= data points) with
          user-generated attributes on a map. The data can then be exported to GIS software and further processed
          according to your needs. FieldMapper offers the opportunity of creating either point features or
          freehand-drawn line features, which enables users to utilise the app in all contexts where spatially coded
          information needs to be transformed into a computer-processable data set. On top of that, you can import your
          own layers and fine-tune the user experience with a variety of options.
        </p>
        <p>
          The documentation covers all relevant topics from importing layers to post-processing the data. 
          Before jumping right into it, I recommended familiarising yourself with the map interface first. 
          You can find a clickable screenshot of the app with explanations on the <a href="index.html">landing page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contributions to the project are most welcome. If you think the app lacks an important feature or its scope
          should be broadened to render different use cases possible, I'd be happy to make this work. Also, if you
          encounter bugs or struggle with the usage of the app, just drop me a line. I'm eager to hear from you if you
          have used the app in your project. Please provide reference to FieldMapper where possible.
        </p>

      <section class="js-section" id="use-cases">
        <h3 class="section__title">Use Cases</h3>
        <p>FieldMapper comes in handy when you want to describe phenomena (objects and processes) as well as conceptions
          thereof and it matters <em>where</em> these things happen or are perceived to have happened. Two general use
          cases come to mind:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Observation of spatially bounded systems</strong><br>I developed the prototype of the app in
              preparation for my Bachelor&#39;s dissertation research project where I conducted fieldwork in a
              neighbourhood park. Among other things, I used the app to count visitors and the frequency of certain
              demographic variables. Because all the data gathered through FieldMapper is tagged with coordinates, you
              can easily detect spatial patterns and clusters of phenomena. You can add custom buttons to the map UI,
              which gives you the opportunity to work with your own variables. Another feature that appears to be
              especially useful in the study of social networks is the &quot;group&quot; functionality which enables you
              to mark interaction between actors.
              Yet, usage of the app is not limited to social research as one can easily imagine to survey abiotic
              components of systems in addition to human actors or even exclusively.<sup><a href="#footnote1"
                  id="ref1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Mapping social routines and perception of place in social research</strong><br>Apart from
              observing visitors, I also employed the app in the context of interviews. Visitors were asked to mark
              areas they consider to be unsafe or their preferred spot under certain circumstances. In this context, the
              ability to draw polylines freehand (which can be transformed into polygons using GIS software) proves
              especially useful. Color codes, timestamps and free text comments are on hand for metadata tagging. </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Whether you are a sociologist who wants to observe people in public spaces systematically, an architecture or
          urban planning student who wants to learn about the ways people navigate through the built environment in
          order to optimise the infrastructural connection or the aesthetics of certain places, or even an ecologist
          counting tree species&mdash;FieldMapper might be the tool you&#39;ve been looking for.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="js-section" id="variable-management"> 
        <h3 class="section__title">Variable Management</h3>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>As your aim is to collect data that suits your research question, you probably want to work with a custom set
          of variables tailored to your case.
          These variables will actually determine the attributes of objects that you add to the map. Once you have
          clicked on <em>Variable Management</em> in the settings tab, you are prompted to add a variable.
          Now just enter the name of the new variable and press enter. The variable shows up in the list below.
          Next to its name you can see two buttons: if you press the left button, you can <em>edit</em> the variable and
          how it appears as a button in the map interface.
          The right button will delete the variable. You can delete all variables at once if click on the three dots in
          the upper right corner and choose &quot;Clear variables&quot;. Note that, if you do not edit the variable, it
          will be operationalised as a boolean variable (see below).</p>
        <h4>Choosing the right type</h4>
        <p>If you click on the edit button, a page opens up where you can change the type, value and icon of the
          variable (button).
          First decide which kind of data you want to encode. Instead of variables we could also speak of attributes
          since Type <em>Boolean</em> generates a single button that can be activated and deactivated.
          Active state means &quot;true&quot;, inactive state means &quot;false&quot;.
          This kind of button makes the most sense when the attribute only has two possible states (dichotomous
          variable) and state 1 equals the negation of state 2, for instance &quot;wears hat/doesn&#39;t wear hat&quot;
          (if you are only interested whether someone wears a hat and not which kind of hat). If you name the variable
          &quot;Hat&quot; or &quot;Wears hat&quot; and choose Boolean as the variable type, &quot;Hat&quot; can be
          either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;.
          If &quot;true&quot;/&quot;false&quot; does not make sense but you still want to operationalise the attribute
          as a dichotomous variable, you can choose <em>Custom binary</em>.
          You can now enter two comma-separated values. The first value will correspond to an inactive button.
          As with most things, you can operationalise an attribute in more than one way. Instead of the following
          configuration ...</p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Name</th>
              <th>Type</th>
              <th>Values</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Hat</td>
              <td>Boolean</td>
              <td>(true, false)</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>... you could also encode the same information with this configuration:</p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Name</th>
              <th>Type</th>
              <th>Values</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Hat</td>
              <td>Custom Binary</td>
              <td>doesn&#39;t wear one, wears one</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>In most cases, working with boolean variables (where reasonable) will make things easier.</p>
        <p>Aside from these, you can also encode non-binary information.
          Imagine you are actually interested in the type of hat a person wears. As there are more than two types of
          hats, both other types do not work.
          We need to choose type <em>Non-dichotomous</em> and enter all possible attribute states we are interest in.
          In our case those could be &quot;Sombrero&quot;, &quot;Beanie&quot; and &quot;Kippah&quot;. Unlike the binary
          types, this will generate not a single button with two states (active and inactive) but a bar of length n =
          number of states/values.</p>
        <h4>Using custom icons</h4>
        <p>Once you have clicked the *Use SVG/PNG icon&quot; option, you can upload your own icons.
          If you disable this option, the first two letters of the variable name (Boolean/Binary) or values
          (Non-dichotomous) will show up as the button icon (which will suffice for most purposes if you do not have a
          couple of variables that share the same initial letters or care much about a visual representation of the
          attributes.)</p>
        <p>You can find free SVG icons in icon libraries such as <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">FontAwesome</a> or
          <a href="https://ionicons.com/">Ionicons</a>. Download them to your device and upload them using the dedicated
          function in the edit menu of the variable.</p>
        <hr />
      </section>
      <section class="js-section" id="options">
        <h3 class="section__title">Options</h3>
        <h4>Toolbars</h4>
        <p>In this section of the options menu you can configure which toolbars you want to have in the map interface.
          Have a look at the <a href="#map-interface">Map Interface section</a> of the documentation if you want to
          find out about the purpose of the different toolbars.</p>
        <h4>Other</h4>
        <p>Let&#39;s break it down (the appearance of some options is dependent on whether you have enabled/disabled
          certain functionalities):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Allow deletion of imported features:
            <p>If you have your own <a href="#layer-management">layers imported</a> into your map, here you can
              determine
              whether you want those to be affected when you delete features on the map (for example with the clear
              button).</p>
          </li>
          <li>Include imported features in export:
            <p>Similarly, here you can decide whether you want to include imported layers when you save the map state as
              GeoJSON. (Imported layers will be saved as a separate file anyway.)</p>
          </li>
          <li>Enable comments:
            <p>Choose whether you want to have a prompt pop up which asks you to add additional information on the
              feature
              after you add a feature to the map.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Only group features of same geometry type:
            <p>If you have enabled the &quot;group&quot; functionality, you can determine whether the algorithm
              distinguishes between points and lines when assigning features a group.
              If enabled, points and lines can&#39;t be in the same group (which leads to groups like p/number/ and
              l/number/), if disabled they can indeed be (simply /number/).</p>
          </li>
          <li>Automatically choose random color for groups:
            <p>If enabled, the color bar disappears from the map interface and the app will iterate over the colors (see
              below) and automatically color features belonging to the same group accordingly.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Feature colors</h4>
        <p>Choose which colors you want to have in the game. Will affect both automatic (see above) and manual coloring
          of features.</p>
        <hr />
      </section>
      <section class="js-section" id="layer-management">
        <h3 class="section__title">Layer Management</h3>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>FieldMapper allows you to import your own layers. It accepts both GeoJSON layers and image overlays.
          The basic process of adding and editing layers is the same as for variables, so have a look at the <a
            href="#variable-management">Variable Management section</a> if you struggle with the basics.</p>
        <h4>GeoJSON and Image Overlay</h4>
        <p>FieldMapper can handle two types of layers: GeoJSON and Image Overlay. GeoJSON is a popular and great to work
          with geodata format. Just upload a GeoJSON file and the layer will appear on the map. (You can disable it in
          the layers control of the map interface.)
          GeoJSON is based on the JSON exchange format which looks as follows:</p>
        <code>
<pre class="code">

{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {
        "color": "green"
      },
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
          13.38778495788574,
          52.515803012883595
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}

</pre>
</code>
        <p>If your imported GeoJSON features have a color attribute in their properties, FieldMapper will automatically
          style them accordingly.</p>
        <p>You can also upload a simple image to the app to account for more complex stylings that GeoJSON is not
          capable of capturing. If you want to import an image overlay, you need to provide the bounds of the area the
          image is meant to represent.</p>
        <p>QGIS has an &quot;export as image&quot; function. If you want to export a layers as an image follow these
          steps (tested with QGIS 3.8):</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Draw on top of a OSM layer or create your custom layers a different way.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Create a extent layer enclosing all relevant layers (in a spatial sense) and extract the layer extent
              (<code>Vector &gt; Research Tools &gt; Extract Layer Extent...</code>).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Go to the attribute table of the resulting layer. You can now extract a pair of coordinates representing
              two diagonally opposite corners of the image layer that you will be asked for in the edit menu of
              FieldMapper:
              <code>&lt;MINX&gt;, &lt;MINY&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;MAXX&gt;, &lt;MAXY&gt;</code>. Make sure the
              coordinates are in WGS84 decimal degree format.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Select <code>File &gt; Import/Export &gt; Export Map to Image</code>. Calculate the extent using your
              extent layer and click save.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section class="js-section" id="data-handling">
        <h3 class="section__title">Data Handling</h3>
        <p>FieldMapper exports GeoJSON files.
          All the attributes you added via the <a href="#variable-management">Variable Management</a>
          interface are stored as properties of the exported features.
          You can access these attributes in the attribute table of the layer after importing the layers into GIS
          software (e.g. QGIS).
          Now you can perform all kind of queries on the data, for example calculating the mean distance between points
          (example use case: distance between home and favourite place for some activity) or rendering a heat
          map.<sup><a href="#footnote2" id="ref2">[2]</a></sup>
          With FieldMapper you can only create points and lines. Lines can be transformed into polygons really easy with
          the help of GIS software.
          In QGIS (tested with v3.8), just use the Polygonize function which can be accessed via
          <code>Vector &gt; Geometry Tools &gt; Lines to Polygons</code>.</p>
        <p>Every feature added to the map has a timestamp which serves as a unique ID (if you prefer a numerical ID you
          can easily generate it from the timestamps with Excel, Python or whichever software/language you use). All
          exported layers also have a timestamp in their file name.
          If you combine FieldMapper with a digital questionnaire or other tools (one exported layer and questionnaire
          per interviewee), you can use algorithms to bring together data from different timecoded sources.
          You can link questionnaire items to FieldMapper features either with color codes (establish conventions where
          you define that the item &quot;Where do your live?&quot; corresponds to blue features beforehand) or by using
          the comments function and providing an item reference.
          If you have a fixed interview procedure and the same number of features per item in every iteration of the
          procedure you could also use the timetags to get item reference.</p>

              Note that the app has difficulty mapping
              processes such as the movement of actors in space. If you repeat surveying the same place, you can of
              course
              record changes in the number and location of actors. Every object placed on the map has a timestamp that
              acts as its unique ID. Accordingly, you will have trouble identifying object A at place B in dataset 2 as
              the same object A that was located 5 m left of B in dataset 1. If you&#39;re dealing with a multitude of
              moving actors, it is unlikely that you are able to map (even discrete) movement anyway. If your survey
              only
              covers a limited number of (hardly mobile) actors you might be able to keep track of change in a system by
              re-importing a layer depicting a prior state and moving markers manually and deleting/adding markers where
              necessary.<a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text."> ↩</a></sub>
          </p>
          <p><strong><sub><a name="footnote1">[2]</a>:</sub></strong><sub>
              You can style point layers as heat maps in QGIS (tested with v3.8) by choosing &quot;heat map&quot; in the
              Symbology section of the Layer Properties menu.
              If the input layers are polygons and you want to calculate the heat from the degree of overlapping,
              generate
              random points in the polygons first
              (<code>Vector &gt; Research Tools &gt; Random Points inside Polygons</code>).
